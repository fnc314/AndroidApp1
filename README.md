Mathify
===========

My First Android App

Mathify is my first attempt at developing for Android.  The goal is to "Mathify" numbers.  The user will input 2 numbers and the app will return a host of 7 different numeric facts about those two numbers.

For the numbers `a` and `b`, the app returns:

-The Sum `a + b`

-The Difference `|a-b|`

-The Product `a*b`

-Two Quotients `a / b` and `b / a`

-Two Modular Calculations `a mod b` and `b mod a`

I will be utilizing many online tutorials including the Android SDK site and YouTube resources.
